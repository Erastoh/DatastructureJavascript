Interview Questions
1. Explain overfitting and underfitting with examples
- overfitting is when the module learns the data too well, it capture noice and irrelevasnt details
- underfitting is when the module is too simple and fails to capture the underlying in the data.

2. What is a confusion matrix and how is it used in evaluating models
- is a table that helps evaluate how well a classification model is performing

3. Define Cross-Validation
- cross-validation is a method used in machine learning to test how well a model will perform on unseen data.
