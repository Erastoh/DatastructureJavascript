// 2048 is a tiny video game that was super hype some years ago.You had to fuse two equal numbers to create its double.So 1 and 1 became 2, 2 and 2 became 4, and so on.

// Fibonacci was a famous mathematician who made the super- hype Fibonacci sequence you may have heard about: U(n + 1) = U(n) + U(n - 1).The first number of the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …

// Let’s combine these two hype things to create a super- super- hype game!

// 2048 - bonacci plays on a 4x4 square.Each square is either empty or contains a number of the Fibonacci sequence.

// You are given an initial board situation(a 2D array of integers) and a pushing direction(up, left, down, or right).Then, you must compute the board contents after the push and return an updated 2D array of integers.

// The value of integers in the array is guaranteed to be less than 2 ^ 16 and are all Fibonacci numbers.The value 0 means the square is empty.
